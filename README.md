# DATA STRUCTURE & ALGORITHM

![Data Structure](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1200/1*KpDOKMFAgDWaGTQHL0r70g.png)

A data structure is a way of organizing data so that it can be accessed and manipulated efficiently. It is a collection of data elements, and the relationships between them. Data structures are used to store data in a way that makes it easy to find, sort, and update.

An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem. It is a set of instructions that can be followed to achieve a specific outcome. Algorithms are used to solve a wide variety of problems, including sorting, searching, and data compression.

The definition of a data structure and algorithm is as follows:

    Data structure: A data structure is a way of organizing data so that it can be accessed and manipulated efficiently.
    Algorithm: An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem.

    Type: There are two main types of data structures: 
    linear and non-linear. 
    Linear data structures are those in which the data elements are arranged in a sequential order. Non-linear data structures are those in which the data elements are not arranged in a sequential order.

### Here are some examples of data structures:

    Linear data structures: 
            Arrays, 
            Linked lists, 
            Stacks, and 
            Queues.


    Non-linear data structures: 
            Trees, 
            Graphs, and 
            Hash tables.

<!-- ### Here are some examples of algorithms:

    Sorting algorithms: 
            Bubble sort, 
            Selection sort, and 
            Merge sort.

    Searching algorithms: 
            Linear search, 
            Binary search, and 
            Hash table search.

    Compression algorithms: 
            Huffman coding, 
            LZW compression, and 
            JPEG compression. -->
